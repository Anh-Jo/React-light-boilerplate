# React-light-boilerplate 

This project is a boilerplate to create a new React App.

It comes with minimal but working things :

```
Babel 7
Webpack 4
React 16+
React-hot-loader
```

### HOW ?

Just clone, then you know : 
```
cd react-light-boilerplate && npm install && npm run dev
```

It run a local server with hot reloading on port `3000`




### WHY ? 
I made this project for two reasons :
- I want my own boilerplate with my configuration, that allow me to create a React project very fast and without messy configuration.
There's no CSS Librairy, Babel plugins like optionnal chainning, or other tweak that I don't need to make a POC for example

- I've made a CLI with NodeJs to initialize React Project and configure it with many choice : CSS librairy, plugins, etc... See here : https://github.com/Anh-Jo/React-init-cli


Enjoy it, don't be afraid to open an issue in need.
